We use Verbatim tag to avoid conflicts with curly braces

For testing with dummy data:
	Model = JS variable
	View = Template of Django
	Controller = JS function   

Using Directives:
	ng-repeat loop over lists
	ng-click to call a function
	ng-model to bind input to scope

We use ng-model to bind 'new_title' property to a our scope
We call $scope.add method with ng-click="add(list,new_title)"

For retrieving data over REST
	-inyect $http service
	-using $http service
	By this way we stop using dummy data and we will
	replace to make calls to an API REST made in django

For quick testing we use:
	-ListAPIView but ViewSets Are more Powerful

So ... For Saving new cards with POST:

-------------In DJANGO config to do a POST-------------------------------
	- We use ViewSets in Django
	- Routers in Django
By this way we simpify common requests Methods on a CARD

We use ModelViewSet:
	For supportting (GET,PUT,POST,DELETE) on a model 
	in this case: a Card

We use Router to register our main url for the API in this case 
	http://localhost:8000/scrumboard/cards/
 	with capacity of GET,POST,PUT,DELETE
	
IMPORTANT!: All URLs end in a slash so we need specify for 
our front-end


-------------In Angular CONFIG to do a POST----------
-We use $http.post() 
and for CSRF protection
