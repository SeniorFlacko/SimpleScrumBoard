We use Verbatim tag to avoid conflicts with curly braces

For testing with dummy data:
	Model = JS variable
	View = Template of Django
	Controller = JS function   

Using Directives:
	ng-repeat loop over lists
	ng-click to call a function
	ng-model to bind input to scope

We use ng-model to bind 'new_title' property to a our scope
We call $scope.add method with ng-click="add(list,new_title)"

For retrieving data over REST
	-inyect $http service
	-using $http service
	By this way we stop using dummy data and we will
	replace to make calls to an API REST made in django
